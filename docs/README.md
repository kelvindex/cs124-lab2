#Task List React App

This simple app allows the following functionalities: 

- Add item to a list
- Mark items that exist in the list
- Toggle between hiding marked items and the full list including these items
- Deleting marked items from the list

Here is an example of what a task list would look like with the current design:

Future iterations of the app will hopefully give the user the ability to delete
individual items from the list and undo these deletes in the order they were made.
